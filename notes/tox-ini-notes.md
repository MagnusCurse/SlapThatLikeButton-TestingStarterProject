# Understanding `tox.ini`

## 1. Purpose of `tox.ini`

The `tox.ini` file is used to configure **tox**, a tool for automating testing in Python projects.

### Key Purposes

- **Define environments** for running tests (e.g., multiple Python versions, different dependency sets).
- **Automate repetitive tasks** such as installing dependencies, running tests, linting, and type checking.
- **Ensure consistency** by verifying that your project works across multiple Python versions and setups.

### How it works

1. You run `tox` in your projectâ€™s root directory.
2. Tox reads `tox.ini`, creates isolated virtual environments, installs the dependencies you define, and runs the specified commands (such as `pytest`).
3. This setup is useful both for **continuous integration (CI)** and for **local development**, since it tests your code in clean, reproducible environments.

## 2. The `commands` Section

In your `tox.ini`, the following line appears inside `[testenv]`:

```ini
commands =
    pytest --basetemp={envtmpdir}
```

1. Specify the command that tox will run in each test environment.
2. It runs pytest and uses a temporary directory ({envtmpdir}) as the base for test files, which helps avoid test pollution between environments.
3. With the default `commands = pytest --basetemp={envtmpdir}` in your tox.ini, tox will run pytest and automatically discover and execute all **test functions** in your **tests folder**
